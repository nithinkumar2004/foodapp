This project is to create an food ordering website using html, css and javascript.

The main page of our website is the ak.html
Our main motive is to ask some suggestions given by the customers to be added in the menu.

Once you reach the ak.html we have 5 several pages that contains:
	1.	about.html - (this page describe about our company and our employees).
	2.	contact.html - (this page describes the personal contact to the admin via phone, mail and others).
	3.	menu.html - (this page describe about the menu of food listed can be ordered and viewed).
	4.	signup.html - (this page describes about the customer can sign in or register an account to have more touch with us or they can save their changes).
	5.	suggestions.html - (this page is for customers where they can suggest a food to be added which is not present in our menu list).

The menu page consists of 20 variety of dishes which has an "Add to Cart" button which is embedded with manu.js and manu.css.
The suggestions.html consists of the customer name and the dish he prefer to be added with suggest.js and suggestion.css.
Each and every page consists of header and footer - the header consists of home, about us, contact, menu, suggestions that lead to their corresponding pages...
